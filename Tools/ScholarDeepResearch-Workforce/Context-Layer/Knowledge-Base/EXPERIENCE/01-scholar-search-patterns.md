## Best Practices Learned

### Query Optimization

- Use 20+ results unless user specifies otherwise
- Prefer advancedScholarSearch for broad queries
- Use scholarSearch for exact title matches

### Database Selection

| Query Type | Primary | Secondary |
|------------|---------|-----------|
| General Academic | Scholar | ArXiv |
| Biomedical | PubMed | bioRxiv |
| Preprints | ArXiv | bioRxiv |
| Patents | patentSearch | Scholar |

### Common Pitfalls

- Don't use platform-specific tools unless Scholar fails after 20 results
- Include "from {database}" in queries for specific platforms
- Always verify results are relevant before presenting
