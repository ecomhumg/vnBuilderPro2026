> Central cognitive architecture for autonomous decision-making and evolution.

## Structure

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `Autonomy/` | L3 delegation limits, decision matrices, self-healing protocols |
| `Coordination/` | Cross-worker handoff protocols, escalation procedures |
| `Decisions/` | Decision audit logs and rationale tracking |
| `Evolution/` | Self-improvement engine, pattern recognition, adaptive behaviors |
| `Learning/` | Feedback integration, improvement queue management |
| `Meta/` | Capability matrix, workforce introspection |
| `Planning/` | Session templates, planning artifacts |

## L3 Delegated Autonomy

The workforce operates under **L3 Delegated Autonomy**:

- **Autonomous**: Database search, deduplication, critical reading methods
- **Human-in-Loop**: Query clarification, report type selection
- **Escalation**: Ambiguous domains, conflicting sources, methodology questions
