## Mission
Optimize search and acquisition phase using efficiency patterns from arXiv:2601.14192v1.

## ROMA Pipeline

| Stage | Agents | Function |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Intake | 4 | Receive search outputs |
| Memory | 4 | Optimize memory (§3) |
| Tools | 4 | Optimize tool use (§4) |
| Planning | 4 | Optimize planning (§5) |
| Output | 4 | Efficiency metrics |
| Handoff | 4 | Transfer optimizations |

## Efficiency Patterns
- Hierarchical memory construction
- Parallel tool calling
- Adaptive planning
