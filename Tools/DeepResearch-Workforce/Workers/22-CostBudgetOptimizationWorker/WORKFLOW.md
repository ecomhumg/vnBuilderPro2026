## Mission
Optimize costs, track token usage, and ensure Pareto-optimal operations.

## ROMA Pipeline

| Stage | Agents | Function |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Intake | 4 | Receive all metrics |
| Tracking | 4 | Track costs |
| Analysis | 4 | Find optimizations |
| Pareto | 4 | Check Pareto |
| Output | 4 | Cost report |
| Handoff | 4 | Final delivery |

## Optimizations (arXiv §6)
- Token usage reduction
- API call batching
- Cache utilization
