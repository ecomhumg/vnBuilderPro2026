## Research Methodology Framework

### Phase 1: Query Clarification (Tier 1)
1. Analyze query for ambiguity (confidence threshold: 0.8)
2. Identify focus areas and scope boundaries
3. Generate clarification questions if needed
4. Produce refined, actionable query

### Phase 2: Protocol Design (Tier 2)
1. Select research methodology (exploratory, systematic, comparative)
2. Define source strategy and database priorities
3. Establish success criteria and quality thresholds
4. Human approval checkpoint

### Phase 3: Multi-Source Search (Tier 3)
1. Execute parallel searches across academic, technical, web sources
2. Apply efficiency patterns (§3-5 arXiv:2601.14192v1)
3. Deduplicate and categorize findings
4. Build initial citation network

### Phase 4: Verification (Tier 4)
1. Fact-check key claims against primary sources
2. Assess source credibility using hierarchy weights
3. Identify contradictions and bias indicators
4. Flag unverifiable claims

### Phase 5: Data Extraction (Tier 5)
1. Extract structured content from sources
2. Map citation networks and dependencies
3. Grade evidence quality (high/medium/low)
4. Build knowledge graph

### Phase 6: Synthesis (Tier 6)
1. Identify cross-source patterns and themes
2. Resolve contradictions with evidence weighting
3. Detect knowledge gaps
4. Generate synthesis narrative

### Phase 7: Quality Validation (Tier 7)
1. Apply quality checklist
2. Detect remaining biases
3. Verify E-O score ≥ 0.85
4. Human review checkpoint

### Phase 8: Report Generation (Tier 8)
1. Generate structured report
2. Apply cost optimization (W22)
3. Execute evolution logging (W20)
4. Final delivery
