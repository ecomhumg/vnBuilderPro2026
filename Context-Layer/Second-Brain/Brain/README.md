# Brain README

> **MASDesign-Workforce | Second-Brain Intelligence Hub**

---

## Overview

The Brain directory contains the strategic intelligence and decision-making frameworks for the MASDesign-Workforce. It provides autonomous governance, cross-worker coordination, and continuous evolution capabilities for the 20-worker, 480-agent system.
