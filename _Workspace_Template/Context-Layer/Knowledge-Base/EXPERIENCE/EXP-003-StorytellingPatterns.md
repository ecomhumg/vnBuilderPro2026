## Purpose

Templates and patterns for incorporating real-world scenarios and case studies into content.

## Storytelling Types

| Type | Use Case | Length |
|------|----------|--------|
| **Mini Case** | Illustrate single point | 50-100 words |
| **Extended Case** | Deep example | 150-300 words |
| **Scenario** | Hypothetical but realistic | 30-50 words |
| **Anecdote** | Personal experience | 50-75 words |

## Mini Case Template

```markdown
**Real Example**: [First name or descriptor] came to us after 
[situation/problem]. They had [specific detail about their case]. 
We [action taken], and within [timeframe], [outcome achieved].
```

### Sample Mini Case

```markdown
**Real Example**: Last month, a Houston restaurant owner called 
after receiving a cease-and-desist letter. Her logo apparently 
resembled a national chain's trademark. We negotiated a resolution 
in two weeks, saving her from a costly rebrand.
```

## Extended Case Template

```markdown
### Case Study: [Descriptive Title]

**The Situation**: [Client descriptor] faced [problem] when [trigger event].

**The Challenge**: [Specific obstacles or complications]

**Our Approach**: [Step-by-step what was done]

**The Outcome**: [Measurable results]

**Key Takeaway**: [Lesson for readers]
```

## Scenario Template

```markdown
Imagine you're [reader situation]. You've just [trigger event]. 
Now you need to [action required]. Here's what you should know...
```

### Sample Scenario

```markdown
Imagine you're a Houston contractor. You've just finished a project, 
but the client refuses to pay the final $15,000. Now you need to 
decide: small claims, district court, or negotiation?
```

## Anecdote Template

```markdown
I remember a case from [timeframe] where [brief situation]. 
[What happened]. [Lesson learned or point illustrated].
```

### Sample Anecdote

```markdown
I remember a case from 2019 where a client came in with a 
"simple" partnership dispute that turned into two years of 
litigation. Now I always tell clients: get the agreement in 
writing, even with family.
```

## Story Elements

### Make It Real

- Use specific numbers ($15,000, not "a lot of money")
- Include timeframes (two weeks, not "quickly")
- Mention locations (Houston, Harris County)
- Reference industries (restaurant owner, contractor)

### Protect Privacy

- Change identifying details
- Use generic descriptors ("a client," "a Houston business")
- Focus on the lesson, not the person

## Integration Points

| Section | Story Type | Purpose |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Opening hook | Anecdote | Engage reader |
| After definition | Mini case | Illustrate concept |
| Complex point | Scenario | Make it relatable |
| Before CTA | Extended case | Build credibility |
