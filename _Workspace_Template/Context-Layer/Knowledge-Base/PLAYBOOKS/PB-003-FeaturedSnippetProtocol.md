> **SEO-AEO-GEO-EEAT-BlogWriter** | Playbook | Strategic Procedure

---

## Purpose

Optimize content structure to win Featured Snippets (Position 0) in Google search results.

## Snippet Types

| Type | Format | Target Length |
|------|--------|---------------|
| **Paragraph** | Direct answer text | 40-75 words |
| **List** | Bulleted/numbered steps | 4-8 items |
| **Table** | Structured data comparison | 3-5 rows |
| **Definition** | What is X? format | 40-60 words |

## Direct Answer Protocol

### Placement

- Immediately after H1 (first 100 words)
- At the start of each H2 section (2-3 sentences)

### Format Template

```markdown
## [Question-Style H2]?

[Direct answer in 40-75 words, stating the key fact immediately. 
No introductory filler. Active voice. Complete, self-contained answer 
that makes sense without reading more.]

[Additional details follow...]
```

### Direct Answer Rules

1. **Start with the answer** - No "Well," "So," or "In this article..."
2. **Front-load keywords** - Put primary keyword early
3. **Complete thought** - Must be extractable as standalone
4. **Natural language** - Reads well aloud (voice search)
5. **Grade 7-9 reading level** - Accessible vocabulary

## List Snippet Optimization

### Ordered Lists (How-to)

```markdown
## How to [Action] [Topic]

Follow these steps to [achieve outcome]:

1. **Step One**: [Concise action]
2. **Step Two**: [Concise action]
3. **Step Three**: [Concise action]
...
```

### Unordered Lists (Best/Top)

```markdown
## [Number] Best [Topic] for [Use Case]

Key [items] to consider:

- **[Item 1]**: [Brief description]
- **[Item 2]**: [Brief description]
- **[Item 3]**: [Brief description]
...
```

## Table Snippet Optimization

```markdown
## [Comparison Topic]

| [Category] | [Option A] | [Option B] |
|------------|------------|------------|
| [Feature 1] | [Value] | [Value] |
| [Feature 2] | [Value] | [Value] |
| [Feature 3] | [Value] | [Value] |
```

## TL;DR Box Format

Place immediately after direct answer:

```markdown
### TL;DR (Key Takeaways)

- **Point 1**: [Concise summary]
- **Point 2**: [Concise summary]  
- **Point 3**: [Concise summary]
