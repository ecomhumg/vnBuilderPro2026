# LLC vs S-Corp in Texas: Which is Right for You?

*Your complete guide to choosing the best business structure for tax savings and liability protection in 2025*

---

## TL;DR: The Quick Answer

**An LLC is a Texas state entity offering liability protection and flexible taxation, while an S-Corp is a federal tax election that can save you thousands in self-employment taxes—but only if your profits exceed approximately $80,000.** Both structures provide identical liability protection. The key difference? S-Corps require you to pay yourself a "reasonable salary" and handle payroll, but distributions above that salary aren't subject to the 15.3% self-employment tax. For Texas business owners, the lack of state income tax makes S-Corp savings even more impactful.

## Understanding the Basics: LLC vs S-Corp

Before diving into the comparison, let's clear up a common misconception: **an S-Corp is not a business entity type—it's a tax election.**

You first form a legal entity (typically an LLC in Texas), then elect to be taxed as an S-Corp by filing IRS Form 2553. This distinction matters because it means you can get the liability protection of an LLC while enjoying the tax benefits of S-Corp treatment.

### What is a Texas LLC?

A **Limited Liability Company (LLC)** is a business structure recognized by the State of Texas that provides:

- **Personal liability protection** – Your personal assets are separate from business debts
- **Pass-through taxation** – Business income flows to your personal tax return
- **Operational flexibility** – Minimal formalities and meeting requirements
- **Management options** – Member-managed or manager-managed structures

By default, a single-member LLC is taxed as a sole proprietorship, while a multi-member LLC is taxed as a partnership. This means all profits are subject to self-employment tax (15.3%).

### What is an S-Corp Election?

An **S-Corporation (S-Corp)** is a federal tax designation that allows your business income to be split between:

1. **Reasonable salary** (subject to 15.3% payroll taxes)
2. **Distributions** (NOT subject to self-employment tax)

This split is where the tax savings come from. If your LLC earns $150,000 and you pay yourself a reasonable salary of $75,000, only that salary is hit with payroll taxes—not the remaining $75,000 in distributions.

### Key Differences at a Glance

| Feature | Texas LLC | LLC with S-Corp Election |
|---------|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Formation** | File Form 205 ($300) | Form 205 + IRS Form 2553 |
| **Liability Protection** | Full | Full (identical) |
| **Self-Employment Tax** | All profits (15.3%) | Salary only |
| **Payroll Required** | No | Yes (reasonable salary) |
| **Texas Franchise Tax** | Same for both | Same for both |
| **Annual Compliance Cost** | $100-$2,000 | $2,000-$7,000+ |
| **Best For** | Under $50K profit | Over $80K profit |

## Formation Requirements in Texas

### How to Form an LLC in Texas

Forming a Texas LLC is straightforward:

1. **Choose a unique business name** – Must include "LLC" or "Limited Liability Company"
2. **Designate a registered agent** – Texas address required for legal documents
3. **File Certificate of Formation (Form 205)** with the Texas Secretary of State
4. **Pay the filing fee** – **$300** (online filing recommended)
5. **Create an Operating Agreement** – Not required by Texas but essential for multi-member LLCs
6. **Obtain an EIN** from the IRS (free)

**Timeline:** 2-5 business days for standard processing; 1 business day for expedited ($25 extra)

### How to Elect S-Corp Status

To add S-Corp tax treatment to your LLC:

1. **First, form your LLC** (complete the steps above)
2. **File IRS Form 2553** – Election by a Small Business Corporation
3. **Meet S-Corp requirements:**
   - 100 or fewer shareholders
   - Only U.S. citizen/resident shareholders
   - Single class of stock
   - No corporate or partnership shareholders
4. **Submit by deadline:**
   - New LLCs: Within 75 days of formation
   - Existing LLCs: By March 15 for the current tax year

**Cost:** Form 2553 is free to file, but CPA assistance typically runs $500-$1,000.

> **Pro Tip:** If you miss the March 15 deadline, you can still elect with reasonable cause using "late election relief" procedures. Consult a tax professional.

### Timeline and Cost Comparison

| Step | LLC Only | LLC + S-Corp |
|------|----------|--------------|
| State formation | $300 | $300 |
| Form 2553 filing | — | $0 (free) |
| CPA setup assistance | $0-$500 | $500-$1,000 |
| Initial payroll setup | — | $200-$500 |
| **Total Formation Cost** | **$300-$800** | **$1,000-$1,800** |

## Tax Implications Compared

This is where the LLC vs S-Corp decision gets serious. Both are "pass-through" entities for federal taxes, but how they handle employment taxes differs dramatically.

### Self-Employment Tax Savings

**For a standard LLC:** You pay 15.3% self-employment tax on ALL net profits. This breaks down as:

- 12.4% Social Security (on first $168,600 in 2025)
- 2.9% Medicare (unlimited)

**For an S-Corp election:** You only pay 15.3% payroll tax on your reasonable salary—not on distributions.

#### How "Reasonable Salary" Works

The IRS requires S-Corp owners to pay themselves a "reasonable" salary for services rendered. This isn't a loophole to avoid all payroll taxes. Factors determining reasonableness include:

- Your duties and responsibilities
- Time and effort devoted
- Comparable salaries in your industry
- Your training and experience
- Business profitability

**General guideline:** If your business nets $150,000, a salary of $70,000-$85,000 is typically considered reasonable for a full-time owner-operator.

### Texas Franchise Tax: Same for Both

Here's good news: **Texas treats LLCs and S-Corps identically for Franchise Tax purposes.**

- **No-tax-due threshold:** $2.47 million in annualized revenue (2025)
- **Rate:** 0.375% (retail/wholesale) or 0.75% (other businesses)
- **Filing deadline:** May 15 annually

Most small businesses fall under the threshold and owe nothing—but you still must file.

### Tax Savings at Different Income Levels

Let's put real numbers to this. Assumptions:

- Single-owner business
- S-Corp adds $3,000/year in compliance costs
- "Reasonable salary" benchmarks from industry standards

| Net Business Profit | LLC Self-Employment Tax | S-Corp Payroll Tax | S-Corp Compliance Cost | **Annual Savings** |
|--------------------|-------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| **$50,000** | $7,650 | $4,590 (on $30K salary) | $3,000 | **$60** |
| **$75,000** | $11,475 | $6,120 (on $40K salary) | $3,000 | **$2,355** |
| **$100,000** | $15,300 | $8,415 (on $55K salary) | $3,000 | **$3,885** |
| **$150,000** | $22,950 | $11,475 (on $75K salary) | $3,000 | **$8,475** |
| **$250,000** | $38,250 | $15,300 (on $100K salary) | $3,000 | **$19,950** |

> **Key Insight:** At $50,000 profit, S-Corp barely breaks even. At $150,000+, you're saving $8,000+ annually—enough to fund retirement contributions or reinvest in growth.

## Ongoing Compliance and Maintenance

The tax savings sound great, but S-Corp status comes with real administrative burden. Let's compare what each structure requires.

### Annual Requirements

**LLC (standard):**

- File Texas Franchise Tax Report by May 15
- Maintain business records
- Keep operating agreement current
- That's essentially it

**LLC with S-Corp election:**

- All LLC requirements PLUS:
- Process payroll for owner(s) at least monthly
- File quarterly Form 941 (federal payroll tax)
- Issue W-2 to owner(s) by January 31
- File Form 1120-S (S-Corp return) by March 15
- Issue Schedule K-1 to shareholders
- Maintain corporate formalities (while not legally required for an LLC, recommended)

### S-Corp Payroll Obligations

Running payroll isn't optional for S-Corp owners. You must:

1. **Calculate and withhold** federal income tax, Social Security, and Medicare
2. **Deposit taxes** semi-weekly or monthly (depending on liability)
3. **File quarterly returns** (Form 941)
4. **Issue annual W-2s** and file with SSA
5. **Pay state unemployment** (Texas Workforce Commission)

Most S-Corp owners use a payroll service like Gusto, Paychex, or ADP. Expect $30-$100/month for basic service.

### Cost of Compliance Comparison

| Expense Category | LLC | LLC + S-Corp |
|------------------|-----|--------------|
| Franchise Tax filing | $0-$300 | $0-$300 |
| Tax return preparation | $500-$1,500 | $1,000-$3,000 |
| Payroll service | $0 | $500-$1,200/year |
| Bookkeeping (if outsourced) | $200-$400/mo | $300-$600/mo |
| **Total Annual** | **$700-$2,500** | **$2,500-$6,000+** |

These costs must be weighed against your tax savings. At $75,000 profit, S-Corp saves ~$2,355 but costs ~$2,000-$3,500 more to maintain. The math gets more favorable as profits increase.

## Which Should You Choose?

After all the numbers, here's the practical decision framework.

### When an LLC is the Better Choice

**Choose a standard LLC if:**

- ✅ Your net profit is under $50,000
- ✅ You value simplicity over tax optimization
- ✅ Your income is unpredictable (feast-or-famine business)
- ✅ You have foreign investors or want complex ownership structures
- ✅ You're testing a business idea and want minimal overhead
- ✅ You're in a low-margin business (consignment, agriculture)

**Real example:** A freelance graphic designer in San Antonio earning $45,000/year. S-Corp savings would be minimal, but she'd add $2,000+ in compliance costs. Stick with an LLC.

### When S-Corp Makes Sense

**Choose S-Corp election if:**

- ✅ Your net profit consistently exceeds $80,000
- ✅ You can accurately predict income for salary calculation
- ✅ You're comfortable with payroll administration (or paying for it)
- ✅ You plan to grow and reinvest profits
- ✅ You want to maximize retirement contributions (solo 401k)
- ✅ You're in a high-margin service business

**Real example:** A Houston-based IT consultant earning $180,000/year. With a $90,000 reasonable salary, she saves over $10,000 annually in self-employment taxes—easily covering compliance costs.

### The $80,000 Decision Threshold

Based on typical compliance costs and tax rates, the **break-even point is approximately $50,000-$80,000 in annual net profit.**

- **Under $50,000:** LLC almost always wins
- **$50,000-$80,000:** Marginal; depends on your tolerance for complexity
- **Over $80,000:** S-Corp typically makes financial sense
- **Over $150,000:** S-Corp is almost certainly the right call

> **Important:** These thresholds assume you're actively working in the business. Passive income (like rental properties) has different rules.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I switch from an LLC to an S-Corp?

**Yes.** Your LLC remains an LLC under Texas law—you're simply changing how it's taxed. File Form 2553 with the IRS by March 15 to elect S-Corp status for the current tax year.

### Does Texas charge different Franchise Tax for S-Corps?

**No.** Texas Franchise Tax treatment is identical for LLCs and S-Corps. Both use the same forms, rates, and thresholds.

### What happens if I set my S-Corp salary too low?

The IRS can reclassify distributions as wages, forcing you to pay back payroll taxes plus penalties and interest. "Reasonable salary" audits are a known enforcement priority—don't get creative here.

### Can my LLC have multiple owners and elect S-Corp?

**Yes.** Multi-member LLCs can elect S-Corp status, but all members must meet eligibility requirements (U.S. citizens/residents, no corporate/partnership shareholders, etc.).

### Should I form a corporation instead of an LLC?

For most Texas small businesses, forming an LLC and electing S-Corp taxation provides the best of both worlds: LLC liability protection and operational flexibility with S-Corp tax savings. Forming a traditional corporation adds formalities without additional benefits for most owners.
