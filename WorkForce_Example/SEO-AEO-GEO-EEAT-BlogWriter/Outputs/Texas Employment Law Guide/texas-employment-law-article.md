## What Every Houston Small Business Owner Needs to Know About Texas Employment Law

Running a small business in Houston means navigating a complex web of employment regulations. Texas employment law differs significantly from other states—sometimes in ways that benefit employers, other times in ways that require careful attention to avoid costly mistakes.

This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about **texas employment law small business** compliance, from hiring to termination, wages to workplace postings.

## Understanding At-Will Employment in Texas

### What At-Will Employment Means

Texas strictly follows the **employment-at-will doctrine**. This means both employers and employees can end the employment relationship at any time, for any lawful reason, without advance notice.

**Example**: You can terminate an employee because they wore a blue shirt on Tuesday—as long as that's not the *real* reason masking an illegal motive.

### The Only Exception: Sabine Pilot Rule

Texas courts recognize just one common law exception from *Sabine Pilot Service, Inc. v. Hauck* (1985):

> **You cannot fire an employee for refusing to commit an illegal act that would expose them to criminal liability.**

This is narrow. The employee must:

- Explicitly refuse the illegal act
- The act must be a crime under law (not just unethical)
- The refusal must be the *sole* reason for termination

### What Texas Does NOT Recognize

Unlike other states, Texas **does not** accept:

- **Implied contract exceptions** – Employee handbooks don't create binding contracts
- **Covenant of good faith** – No duty to treat employees "fairly" beyond legal requirements

**Best Practice**: Include clear at-will disclaimers in all offer letters and employee handbooks.

## Texas Payday Law: Paying Your Employees Correctly

The **Texas Payday Law** (Texas Labor Code Chapter 61) governs when and how you must pay employees.

### Pay Period Requirements

| Employee Type | Minimum Pay Frequency |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Hourly (Non-Exempt) | Semi-monthly (twice per month) |
| Salaried (Exempt) | Monthly |

### Final Paycheck Deadlines

| Situation | Deadline |
|-----------|----------|
| **Terminated by employer** | Within 6 calendar days |
| **Employee quits** | Next regular payday |

**Warning**: Missing these deadlines can result in TWC claims and penalties.

### What You Can (and Cannot) Deduct

**Allowed with written consent**:

- Uniform costs
- Tools provided to employee
- Insurance premiums

**Allowed without consent**:

- Court-ordered garnishments
- Child support withholdings
- Tax withholdings

**Never deduct without consent**:

- Cash register shortages
- Customer walkouts
- Damaged equipment

## Minimum Wage and Overtime Requirements

### Current Texas Minimum Wage

| Rate | Amount | Effective |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Standard minimum wage | $7.25/hour | Federal rate applies |
| Sub-minimum (new hires under 20) | $4.25/hour | First 90 days only |
| Tipped employees | $2.13/hour | Tips must bring total to $7.25 |

### Overtime Rules

Non-exempt employees must receive **1.5 times their regular rate** for hours worked over 40 in a workweek.

**Key 2024-2025 Update**: A federal court ruling in November 2024 invalidated the DOL's planned salary threshold increases. The exemption threshold remains:

| Threshold | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Weekly salary | $684/week |
| Annual salary | $35,568/year |

### Who Is Exempt from Overtime?

To qualify, employees must pass THREE tests:

1. **Salary-basis test**: Paid a fixed, predetermined amount
2. **Salary-level test**: At least $684/week
3. **Duties test**: Must perform executive, administrative, or professional duties

**Important**: Job title alone doesn't determine exemption—actual duties control.

## Anti-Discrimination Laws: TCHRA and Federal Protections

### Texas Commission on Human Rights Act (TCHRA)

**Coverage**: Applies to employers with **15 or more employees**

## Workers' Compensation in Texas: The Non-Subscriber Option

|------|------|
| No premium costs (1-2% payroll savings) | Full liability in negligence lawsuits |

## Employee Classification: W-2 vs. 1099 Contractors

Misclassifying employees as independent contractors is one of the most common—and costly—employer mistakes.

### The IRS Common-Law Test

Texas follows federal IRS standards using three categories:

**1. Behavioral Control**

- Do you control *how* the work is done?
- Do you provide training?

**2. Financial Control**

- Does the worker have unreimbursed expenses?
- Can they earn profit or suffer loss?

**3. Relationship Type**

- Is there a written contract?
- Are benefits provided?

### Consequences of Misclassification

- Back payment of wages and overtime
- Unpaid employment taxes plus penalties
- TWC investigations
- Potential lawsuits

**Safe harbor**: Use IRS Form SS-8 for formal classification determinations.

Within 6 calendar days if you terminate them. If they quit, by the next regular payday. Failure to comply can result in TWC claims.

The Texas Commission on Human Rights Act (TCHRA) applies to employers with 15 or more employees. Smaller businesses still have federal FLSA and other obligations.
