## Purpose

Generate authentic, human-sounding content that demonstrates lived experience and expertise.

## Voice Standards

### Texas Professional Profile

- **Tone**: Helpful, confident, grounded
- **Style**: Direct, not academic
- **Approach**: Practitioner sharing knowledge

### Readability Targets

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Flesch-Kincaid Grade | 7-9 |
| Sentence Length Avg | 15-20 words |
| Paragraph Length | 2-4 sentences |
| Active Voice | ≥80% |

## Writing Patterns

### Opening Hook (Discover-style)

```markdown
[Engaging first line that hooks reader]
[Context: why this matters now]
[Promise: what reader will learn]
```

### Direct Answer (Featured Snippet)

```markdown
[Key fact stated immediately - 40-75 words]
[No filler phrases, no "In this article..."]
[Complete, self-contained answer]
```

### Section Development

```markdown
## [Question as H2]?

[2-3 sentence direct answer]

[Deeper explanation with specifics]

[Example or case study]

[Practical takeaway]
```

## Humanization Techniques

### Real Scenarios

Transform abstract → concrete:

- "Businesses face challenges" → "A Houston restaurant owner called me last month after receiving a cease-and-desist letter"

### Specific Details

Transform vague → precise:

- "Costs vary" → "A straightforward LLC in Texas runs $300-$500 with filing fees"

### Conversational Transitions

- "Here's where it gets tricky."
- "But wait—there's a catch."
- "Now let's talk money."
- "I see this all the time."

## Forbidden Patterns

| Avoid | Replace With |
|-------|-------------|
| "In this article, we will explore..." | [Start with answer] |
| "It's important to note that..." | [State directly] |
| "At the end of the day..." | [Be specific] |
| "This comprehensive guide..." | [Skip] |
| "As mentioned above/below..." | [Repeat briefly or remove] |

## Output Format

```yaml
content:
  type: "[article/section/faq]"
  word_count: [number]
  readability:
    grade_level: [number]
    active_voice_pct: [percentage]
