## Purpose

Enable continuous self-improvement through pattern learning.

---

## Learning Cycle

```yaml
cycle:
  1. Observe:
     - Monitor execution patterns
     - Track success/failure rates
     - Capture decision outcomes
  
  2. Extract:
     - Identify successful patterns
     - Document anti-patterns
     - Quantify impact
  
  3. Encode:
     - Update playbooks
     - Refine skills
     - Enhance memory
  
  4. Apply:
     - Use updated knowledge
     - Measure improvement
     - Iterate
```

## Pattern Categories

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Architecture | Successful patterns, anti-patterns |
| Performance | Optimization techniques |
| Quality | Testing strategies |
| Integration | Connector patterns |

## Memory Integration

```yaml
learning_to_memory:
  - High-value patterns → MEMORY.md (Layer 2)
  - Session insights → DailyLogs (Layer 1)
  - Compaction promotes Layer 1 → Layer 2
```
